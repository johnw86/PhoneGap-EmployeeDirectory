# PhoneGap Workshop #

App was originally developed following http://coenraets.org/blog/phonegap-tutorial/

I've will be working through some enhancements to the initial tutorial app:

- ~~Ability to manage contacts via the app~~
	- ~~Create edit view~~
	- ~~Save updates to database~~
- Save new photo's to file system
- Review transitions should back take you to previous view not home?
- Tidy routing method with multiple pages
- Add extra contact numbers
